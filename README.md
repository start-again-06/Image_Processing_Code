🖼️ Contour Detection with OpenCV
This repository contains a Python script that detects contours in an image using OpenCV and labels key points on the detected contours.

📌 Features
✅ Reads an image in grayscale
✅ Applies thresholding to segment objects
✅ Detects contours using OpenCV
✅ Draws and labels contour points on the image
✅ Displays the processed image with annotations

📦 Requirements
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
[pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib](url)
🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ Load Image: Reads an image in grayscale.
2️⃣ Apply Thresholding: Converts the image to binary format.
3️⃣ Find Contours: Detects object boundaries.
4️⃣ Draw Contours: Outlines detected objects in red.
5️⃣ Annotate Contours:

Labels the first contour point as "Arrow tip" 🎯
Marks other vertices with their coordinates 📍
6️⃣ Display Image: Shows the final processed image.
🛠️ Usage
1️⃣ Replace the image path in the script:

python
Copy
Edit
[img2 = cv2.imread(r"C:\path\to\your\image.png", 0)](url)
2️⃣ Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
[python script.py](url)
3️⃣ The processed image will appear. Press 'q' to close the window.
